# Password Generator

A simple yet effective password generator application built with Python and Tkinter. This application allows users to create secure, random passwords by specifying the desired length. It provides an easy-to-use graphical interface with features like copying the generated password to the clipboard.

## Features

- **Customizable Password Length**: Allows users to specify the length of the password.
- **Random Password Generation**: Generates a secure password using uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
- **Copy to Clipboard**: Quickly copy the generated password to the clipboard for easy use.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Designed with Tkinter for a clean and simple GUI.


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.6+**: Ensure Python is installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository** (or download the ZIP and extract it):
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/password-generator.git
   cd password-generator
   ```

2. **Install Tkinter** (if it’s not already included with your Python installation):
   - **Linux**: You may need to install Tkinter manually.
     ```bash
     sudo apt-get install python3-tk
     ```
   - **Windows and macOS**: Tkinter is typically included with Python installations, so additional setup may not be required.

### Running the Application

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd password-generator
   ```
3. Run the Python file:
   ```bash
   python password_generator.py
   ```

The password generator window should open, allowing you to enter the desired length, generate a password, and copy it to your clipboard.

## Usage

1. **Enter Password Length**: Specify the number of characters for your password in the input field.
2. **Generate Password**: Click the "Generate Password" button to create a password.
3. **Copy to Clipboard**: After generating a password, click "Copy to Clipboard" to copy it for easy use.

## Code Overview

- **`generate_password()`**: This function generates a password based on the length provided by the user, using uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
- **`copy_to_clipboard()`**: This function copies the generated password to the clipboard for easy access.
- **Tkinter GUI Elements**: The app uses Tkinter widgets for a user-friendly GUI, including labels, buttons, and entry fields.

## Customization

You can modify the password generation criteria (e.g., character set) or adjust the styling in the following ways:

- **Adjust Character Types**: Modify the `characters` variable in the `generate_password()` function to include or exclude certain character types.
- **Change Styles**: Customize colors, fonts, and sizes in the Tkinter widgets to create a different look for the GUI.

## Example Output

When you run the application, the interface should look similar to this (replace this section with a screenshot if possible).
